I don't think that applies here in either case, and so the agent would just be able to access the content.  But, if you are talking about the latter exclusively, which is AI and it is using the data, it's not entirely clear from what the draft includes.  Other similar systems separate out training and inference, where I chose not to, so this does create some ambiguity.\n\nClarifying that is a good idea, but I don't know which way this needs to point.  There's a lot riding on \"when directed by a user\" in your question.  That might mean that content is \"used\" by the person or it could be \"used\" by the agent, with the line between the two being pretty unclear.",

          "body": "I see where you are going, but I don't see this as materially different than 'n'.  It is always possible to include licensing information that can override preferences.  In most cases, a URL won't help an automated processor decide whether it can use content, because licenses are often just a reference to a legal document.  Some URLs might reference structured content (or reference a document containing structured content) that an automaton can use.  Where URLs are effectively identifiers and the automaton is able to know that it complies with a license, that is maybe a case for this.\n\nIn all of these case, these decisions can be made without a specific signal here.  There are existing mechanisms for signaling licensing terms in the form of a URL.  Unfortunately, there are an awful lot of them, but these preferences would not override any established licensing terms, they would only apply where those terms either allowed it, where the automaton is unable to determine that it is compliant with terms, or where there are no terms.",

In that view, if there is anything that someone might seek to avoid, that would not be the acquisition of information, but its ultimate use.  That is, an artist might be less concerned about something looking at a painting than having that painting -- or aspects of it -- copied.\n\nIn contrast, the [openfuture report](https://openfuture.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/250307_Vocabulary_for_opting_out_of_AI_training_and_other_forms_of_TDM.pdf) takes the opposing view: that use in inference is distinct from training.  The report acknowledges that there might be a desire to constrain things like <acronym title=\"Retrieval Augmented Generation\">RAG</acronym> and that it might be necessary to expand the scope to include inference.  The obvious question there is whether the definition of existing categories can be expanded, or whether new categories would be needed.",
